##Cult Leader 214 
*Because we forgot the Zero.*

Mankind has fallen. The Ancient ones have returned to reclaim the earth, which was consumed in one glorious moment. However, some men refuse to embrace their fate. They flee the planet in desperation, escaping on a massive generation ship, believing they can circumvent the will of the Elder Gods. Only you can show them the error of their ways. Cult Leader, can you lead your people to glorious oblivion, an end to all-things?
